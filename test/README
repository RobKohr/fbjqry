This is a RingoJS application. To run it launch ringo with the main script:

    cd fbjqry/test;
    ringo main.js [CANVAS_CALLBACK_URL]

Then point your browser to this url to verify the server works:

    http://localhost:8080/

The returned content is FBML and is meaningless in a "normal" browser, You
need the FBML interpreter to process the returned markup content.
Setup a facebook application with the callback url pointing to the server :

    http://[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]:8080/

If You don't have a public ip address, You might use ssh to tunnel Your traffic
to a host with public ip. There are sites providing ssh tunneling as a service
such as http://tunnlr.com/. Sample ssh tunnel setup with tunnlr.com :

    ssh -v -nNT4 -R *:[TUNNLR_PORT]:localhost:8080 [TUNNLR_USER]@ssh1.tunnlr.com

Restart the server with the correct canvas callback url for development e.g. :

    ringo main.js http://web1.tunnlr.com:11164

Now verify Your facebook application works by going to :

    http://apps.facebook.com/[CANVAS_PATH]/

By default all test suites will run, if You want to limit to a particular suite
(useful during development) use the run parameter e.g. :

    http://apps.facebook.com/[CANVAS_PATH]/?run=traversingSuite

This assumes a <code>traversingSuite</code> exists and is a valid test suite.
